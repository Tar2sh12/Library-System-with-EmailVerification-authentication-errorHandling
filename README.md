# Book and Author Management Application

Welcome to the Book and Author Management Application README! This application allows you to manage a collection of books and authors through a RESTful API.

## Features

- Define Models:
  - **Book Model**:
    - title (String, required)
    - content (String, required)
    - author (String, required)
    - publishedDate (Date, default to the current date)
  - **Author Model**:
    - name (String, required, unique)
    - bio (String)
    - birthDate (Date)
    - books (Array of ObjectIds referencing Book model)

- Test the Application:
  - Use Postman or any API testing tool to interact with the endpoints.
  - Supported API Endpoints:
    - **Books**:
      - `POST /api/books` - Create a new book.
      - `GET /api/books` - Retrieve all books (with pagination support).
      - `GET /api/books/:id` - Retrieve a single book by its ID.
      - `PATCH /api/books/:id` - Update a book by its ID.
      - `DELETE /api/books/:id` - Delete a book by its ID.
    - **Authors**:
      - `POST /api/authors` - Create a new author.
      - `GET /api/authors` - Retrieve all authors (with pagination support).
      - `GET /api/authors/:id` - Retrieve a single author by their ID (with their books listed).
